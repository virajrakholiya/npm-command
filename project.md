# DevCommand - NPM Manager

**DevCommand** is a professional Chrome extension designed for developers to streamline their workflow by managing and organizing frequently used terminal commands (NPM, Git, Docker, etc.) directly in the browser's side panel.

## What DevCommand Does

### 1. Unified Command Organization
DevCommand allows you to create custom **Folders** to categorize your commands. Whether it's Frontend setup, Backend utilities, or specific DevOps scripts, you can keep everything structured and easy to find.

### 2. Fast Access & Copying
The extension lives in the Chrome **Side Panel**, meaning it's always accessible without switching tabs. Every command can be copied to your clipboard with a single click, eliminating the need to type out long, complex commands or search through notes.

### 3. Folder Management
- **Create Folders**: Add new categories with distinct colors to keep your list organized.
- **Rename Folders**: Change folder names anytime to suit your project evolution.
- **Delete Folders**: Remove entire categories with a safe confirmation dialog to prevent data loss.

### 4. Command Management
- **Add Commands**: Quickly add new commands to any folder.
- **Edit & Update**: Modify existing commands if parameters change.
- **Delete Commands**: Clean up your list by removing commands you no longer need.

### 5. Professional UI/UX
Designed with a sleek, modern **Dark Theme**, DevCommand focuses on visual hierarchy and clarity.
- **Expand/Collapse**: Keep your workspace tidy by toggling folder visibility.
- **Edit Mode**: A dedicated "Edit Mode" toggle ensures you don't accidentally delete or modify your commands during normal use.
- **Micro-animations**: Smooth transitions and hover effects for a premium feel.

### 6. Privacy & Security
- **Local Storage**: All your commands are stored locally on your device using `chrome.storage.local`.
- **No External Calls**: DevCommand does not send your data to any servers, ensuring your commands remain private.
- **Chrome Guideline Compliant**: Built using Manifest V3, following all latest security and performance best practices.

## Goal
To reduce developer friction and context-switching by providing a beautiful, fast, and reliable hub for your most important development commands.
